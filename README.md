## Forecast Tiers

| Tier | Name | Magnitude | Forecast Window | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **T1** | Micro | M ≥ 2.5 | 2 days | Microseismic activity (generally not felt) |
| **T2** | Felt | M ≥ 4.5 | 2 days | Earthquakes typically felt by people |
| **T3** | Minor | M ≥ 5.5 | 3 days | Potential for minor structural damage |
| **T4** | Damage | M ≥ 6.0 | 3 days | Significant earthquake with damage potential |

---

## Zone Coverage

The model covers **563 seismically active zones** worldwide, defined on a 5° × 5° global grid. Zones are identified by their southwest corner coordinates (e.g., `Z_35_-120` covers 35°N to 40°N, 120°W to 115°W).

Coverage includes major seismic regions:
- Pacific Ring of Fire
- Mediterranean-Himalayan Belt
- Mid-Atlantic Ridge
- East African Rift
- And other seismically active areas

---

## Calibration Files

The `/calibration` folder contains static model configuration files committed once at deployment. These files define how predictions are generated and how alert thresholds are set.

### `v200_global_calibrated_thresholds.json`

Contains the probability thresholds used to generate alerts at each budget level for each tier:

```json
{
  "model_version": "V200_Global_Production",
  "training_date": "2026-01-21",
  "calibration_period": {

## Performance Dashboard

### Important: Dashboard Scope

> ⚠️ **The dashboard reports performance metrics for a subset of zones only.**
>
> **Predictions are generated daily for all 563 active zones worldwide.** However, the performance dashboard focuses on a curated list of approximately **150-200 "Viable Zones"** — commercially significant locations prioritized for insurance and infrastructure applications.
>
> This subset was selected based on population exposure, infrastructure density, and historical seismic significance. If you need performance metrics for zones outside the viable list, contact us for custom analysis.

### Dashboard Files

The `/dashboards` folder contains two types of performance reports, updated daily after each verification cycle:

#### 1. Aggregated Performance (`aggregated/YYYY-MM-DD_viable_performance.json`)

Overall model performance computed across **all viable zones combined**:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "metrics_date": "2026-01-23",
    "scope": "VIABLE_ZONES_ONLY",
    "n_viable_zones": 178,
    "n_total_active_zones": 563,
    "windows": [7, 30, 90]
  },
  "performance": {
    "30d": {
      "T4_damage": {
        "1.0pct": {
          "n_predictions": 5340,
          "n_events": 23,
          "base_rate": 0.0043,
          "hits": 18,
          "false_alarms": 36,
          "misses": 5,
          "true_negatives": 5281,
          "precision": 0.333,
          "recall": 0.783,
          "f1_score": 0.467,
          "far": 0.007,
          "lift": 8.2,
          "alert_rate": 0.010
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Per-Zone Performance (`per_zone/YYYY-MM-DD_zone_performance.json`)

Individual performance metrics broken down by each viable zone, enabling location-specific analysis and comparison.

## Understanding the Metrics

### Confusion Matrix Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Hit (True Positive)** | Alert was issued AND an earthquake occurred in the window |
| **Miss (False Negative)** | No alert was issued BUT an earthquake occurred |
| **False Alarm (False Positive)** | Alert was issued BUT no earthquake occurred |
| **True Negative** | No alert was issued AND no earthquake occurred |

### Performance Metrics Explained

| Metric | Formula | What It Means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Precision** | Hits ÷ (Hits + False Alarms) | "When we alert, how often are we right?" Higher precision means fewer false alarms per alert issued. |
| **Recall** | Hits ÷ (Hits + Misses) | "Of all earthquakes that occurred, what fraction did we alert for?" Higher recall means we catch more events. |
| **F1 Score** | 2 × (Precision × Recall) ÷ (Precision + Recall) | Harmonic mean of precision and recall — balances both concerns. |
| **False Alarm Rate (FAR)** | False Alarms ÷ (False Alarms + True Negatives) | "What fraction of quiet days triggered alerts?" Lower is better. |
| **Lift** | Precision ÷ Base Rate | "How many times better than random guessing?" A lift of 8× means our alerts are 8 times more likely to precede an earthquake than random chance. |
| **Base Rate** | Total Events ÷ Total Predictions | Natural frequency of earthquakes — what you'd achieve by random guessing. |
| **Alert Rate** | (Hits + False Alarms) ÷ Total Predictions | Fraction of zone-days that triggered alerts at this budget level. |

### Interpreting the Metrics

| Metric | Good Value | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Precision** | > 0.20 for T4 | 1 in 5 alerts results in an event (very good for rare events) |
| **Recall** | > 0.70 | Capturing 70%+ of all damaging earthquakes |
| **Lift** | > 5× | 5× better than random — strong predictive signal |
| **FAR** | < 0.02 | Less than 2% of quiet days trigger false alarms |

### Rolling Windows

Metrics are computed over three time horizons:

| Window | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **7-day** | Recent performance snapshot (more volatile, useful for detecting sudden changes) |
| **30-day** | Medium-term trend (recommended for routine monitoring) |
| **90-day** | Long-term baseline (most stable, best for overall model assessment) |

## Understanding Probability and Alerts

### Probability Values

Each zone receives a probability estimate (0.0 to 1.0) for each tier, representing the likelihood of at least one earthquake at or above that magnitude occurring within the forecast window.

### Alert Budgets

Alerts are triggered when a zone's probability exceeds a calibrated threshold. The budget levels represent different sensitivity settings:

| Budget | Meaning | Typical Use Case |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **0.5%** | Highest threshold, fewest alerts (~4 alerts/day globally) | Critical infrastructure, nuclear facilities |
| **1.0%** | Very selective (~8 alerts/day) | High-consequence decisions |
| **2.0%** | Selective (~17 alerts/day) | Elevated preparedness |
| **5.0%** | Moderate (~42 alerts/day) | General monitoring |
| **10.0%** | Sensitive (~85 alerts/day) | Broad awareness, research |

**The budget percentage indicates approximately what fraction of zone-days will trigger alerts.** At 1% budget, roughly 1% of all daily zone predictions will be flagged.

---

## Verification & Integrity

### Immutable Timestamps

Each prediction file is committed to GitHub **before** the forecast window begins. The Git commit timestamp provides cryptographic proof that predictions were made in advance, enabling independent verification by any third party.

### Data Integrity

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `data_hash` | SHA-256 hash of prediction content for tamper detection |
| Git commit hash | Immutable record of exactly when predictions were published |

Third parties can clone this repository and verify that predictions were committed before the earthquakes they predicted.

## Limitations & Disclaimers

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Please read carefully**

1. **Not deterministic prediction**: Earthquakes cannot be predicted with certainty. These are probabilistic forecasts indicating relative likelihood.

2. **Not evacuation guidance**: These forecasts are NOT intended for evacuation decisions or emergency response. Always follow guidance from official agencies (USGS, local emergency management).

3. **No liability**: These forecasts are provided for informational and research purposes. The authors assume no liability for decisions made based on this data.

4. **Baseline risk exists everywhere**: A zone without alerts still has seismic risk. Absence of alert ≠ safety guarantee.

5. **Model limitations**: Like all models, this will produce both false positives (alerts without events) and false negatives (events without alerts).

6. **Dashboard scope**: Performance metrics cover only the ~178 viable zones, not all 563 predicted zones. Contact us for metrics on other zones.
